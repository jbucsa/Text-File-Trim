# Text-File-Trim


## How it Works:

1. Import ```re```: This imports the ```re``` module, which provides tools for working with regular expressions.
2. ```remove_numbers_from_end``` Function:
- Opens the file: It opens the specified file (```file_path```) in read mode (```"r"```).
- Reads lines: It reads all the lines from the file into a list called ```lines```.
- Regular Expression (Regex):
+ ```\s+```: Matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs).
+ ```\d+```: Matches one or more digits.
+ ```(\.\d+)?```: Optionally matches a decimal point followed by one or more digits.
+ ```$```: Ensures the match occurs at the end of the line.
- Replace and Store: It iterates through each line, uses ```re.sub``` to remove matching patterns (numbers at the end), and stores the modified lines in ```modified_lines```.
- Overwrite: It opens the file again in write mode (```"w"```) and writes the modified lines back to the file, effectively replacing the original content.

3. User Input: The code prompts the user to enter the file path.
4. Function Call: It calls the ```remove_numbers_from_end``` function with the provided file path.
5. Success Message: It prints a message indicating the removal was successful.


## Key improvements:

- Concise Regex: Uses a compact and efficient regular expression for pattern matching.
- In-place modification: Modifies the original file directly for convenience.
- Error handling: You could easily add a try-except block to handle cases where the file might not exist or be inaccessible.
